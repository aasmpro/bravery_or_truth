bravery or truth

just a simple game for when a group don't know what to do!

each time it will print two names and the act to be done by second player like this :

person_1  :  person_2  >>  truth

    so person_1 ask a question from person_2, so player_2 must answer it.
    
person_1  :  person_2  >>  bravery

    this time person_1 will ask person_2 to do something, so player_2 must do it.
